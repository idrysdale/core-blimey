<img class="w-full mx-auto my-4" src="https://www.verywellfit.com/thmb/ZdEiRKHTe7VLmpEkkYOLcmwzao8=/3000x2000/filters:fill(FFDB5D,1)/22-2704722-Leg-Pull-Front-ExcersiceGIF-bfba4cddc8cc496091dda1ca68c96529.gif" class="mb-2">

<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
Begin leg pull front in the plank position: Start on your knees. Place your hands on the floor in front of you, fingers pointing straight ahead. Keep your arms straight and your elbows unlocked.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
Engage your abdominals and lengthen your spine, extending through the top of the head as you lean forward to put your weight on your hands. Your shoulders should be directly over your wrists and settled in your back. That means there is a lot of space between your shoulders and your ears.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
With your abdominals lifted, extend your legs back so that they are straight and together. Your toes are curled under so that some weight is on the balls of your feet. Your ears, shoulders, hips, and heels should be in one long line. Now you are ready to begin.
</p>

<ul class="text-left mb-4 text-sm list-disc ml-4">
    <li class="mb-2">Extend one leg from the hip so that your foot lifts off the mat a few inches. Your foot can point softly as it is released from the mat. As you extend your leg, your hip will lift slightly, but the challenge is to keep the rest of your body stable in plank position. This requires extra work from your abdominals, shoulders, and back.</li>
    <li class="mb-2">Return your foot to the mat and extend the other leg.</li>
</ul>

        <h3 class="text-3xl capitalize">Glute march</h3>

<img class="w-full mx-auto my-4" src="https://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/XEjDZ0M2JJ8-1oiUPBM-0ycnaIQ/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/07/28/857/n/1922729/72c654c374292398_BridgeWithKneeUps.gif" class="mb-4">

<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
To do the Glute Bridge With March, lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Your feet should be about hip-width apart and your knees should be in line with your feet and hips. Your feet should be just beyond your fingers when you stretch your arms down by your sides.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
Bend your arms to 90 degrees and then drive through your arms, upper back and heels to bridge up. Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs to bridge up.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
Holding this bridge, lift one foot up off the ground, bringing your knee in toward your chest as if marching. Do not let your hips sag as you lift the leg.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
Move slowly to lift the leg then lower back down and switch, bringing the other knee in toward your chest.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
Do not let your hips sag as you march. Also, do not let your low back take over. Keep your abs engaged and really focus on making the glute of the leg that is down work to keep your hips up.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
You may not want to lift your leg as high if you struggle to maintain the bridge. Doing a smaller march means that each side has to work independently for shorter, which can make the move a bit easier.

<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
    Lay on the floor on your stomach. Lift your body off the ground, supporting your upper body with your elbows directly under your shoulders and your forearms flat on the ground. Keep your body in a straight line from your shoulders to your heels and hold.
</p>

<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
    Roll your shoulders back before you get into position. This will help sustain an open chest during your plank. Psst: Squeeze your butt! It'll facilitate a flat, lower back through the entire exercise, which will keep you from rounding or hyperextending the lumbar spine, which could lead to disc herniations and pinched nerves.

<p class="text-left mb-4 text-sm">
    Sit on the floor and bring your legs out straight. Lean back slightly so your torso and legs form a V-like shape, bracing your abdominal wall to engage your core. Balancing here, twist your torso from side to side without moving your legs.
